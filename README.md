Users can view weather conditions, toggle between temperature units, filter results, and chat with the bot for additional information.

### Features

- **Weather Forecast**: Search for weather conditions in different cities.
- **Temperature Unit Toggle**: Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through multiple pages of weather data.
- **Rainy Days Filter**: Filter forecast data to show only rainy days.
- **Chatbot**: Ask weather-related questions and receive responses via a chatbot.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
